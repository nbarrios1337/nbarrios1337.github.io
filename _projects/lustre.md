A personal project to both learn the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), as well as understanding the basics behind 3D rendering using raytracing and pathtracing. Based on [Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend Book Series](https://raytracing.github.io/), my renderer encapulates the features in the first 2 books.
