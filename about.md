## Welcome! My name is Nicolas Barrios

I'm interested in heterogenous programming models and squeezing every drop of program performance, though my professional experience in either leaves much to be desired.
Though I'm fixing that!

I'm a Software Engineer over at [Bolt Graphics](https://bolt.graphics/), where I take part in developing our novel, hardware-accelerated raytracing platform.

I'm a [SUNY University at Buffalo](https://buffalo.edu/) graduate, with a [combined BS/MS Computer Science degree](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/undergraduate/degrees-and-programs/bs-ms-in-computer-science-and-engineering.html) specializing in Software and Distributed Systems.
